llvm_link
---

High level `libLTO` bindings for Rust.

[Documentation](https://valarauca.github.io/llvm_link/llvm_link/index.html)

This crate expects llvm v3.9.1, higher or lower may present a problem.

All development work was done on Fedora25. So building on Windows/OSX isn't strictly
supported yet.
